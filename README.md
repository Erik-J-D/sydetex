# sydetex

A Latex style that aims to match the SYDE uWaterloo style guide. There is an example WTR and an example Report to see how it's used.

## To use

The easiest way to start using this template is to make a [sharelatex.com](https://www.sharelatex.com?r=cecee823&rm=d&rs=b) account if you don't already have one and make a copy of the [project here](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/56b37bca3933941474671c13). I will try to remember to keep this link updated whenever I change the repo...

You could also install a tex distribution locally (like [texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or equivalent) but then you either have to manage libraries yourself or grab a distribution with everything ever.
